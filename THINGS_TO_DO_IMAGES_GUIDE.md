# 📸 Things to Do in Agra - Image Guide

## Image Requirements

I've added a "Things to Do in Agra" section above the "Why Book with Local Guides" section. The section displays 4 main attractions with expandable cards (similar to GetYourGuide).

## 📁 Where to Place Images

Place your images in the `public/things-to-do/` directory with these exact filenames:

1. **Taj Mahal Sunrise Tour**
   - File: `public/things-to-do/agra-taj-mahal-sunrise.jpg`
   - Recommended: Image showing Taj Mahal at sunrise with golden lighting

2. **Agra Fort Heritage Walk**
   - File: `public/things-to-do/agra-fort.jpg`
   - Recommended: Image showing the red sandstone Agra Fort exterior or interior

3. **Baby Taj & Mehtab Bagh**
   - File: `public/things-to-do/agra-baby-taj.jpg`
   - Recommended: Image showing Baby Taj (Itmad-ud-Daulah) or Mehtab Bagh with Taj Mahal view

4. **Fatehpur Sikri Day Trip**
   - File: `public/things-to-do/agra-fatehpur-sikri.jpg`
   - Recommended: Image showing Buland Darwaza or Fatehpur Sikri architecture

## 🎨 Image Specifications

- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size:** 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)

## 📝 Content Included

Each card includes:
- **Title** - SEO-optimized heading
- **Short Description** - Visible by default (first paragraph)
- **Full Description** - Expanded content with detailed information
- **SEO Keywords** - Built into the descriptions

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Cards start collapsed showing short description
2. Click "See more" to expand and see full description
3. Click "See less" to collapse back
4. Images load from `/things-to-do/` directory
5. If image not found, shows placeholder automatically

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Add your 4 images to `public/things-to-do/` directory
2. Name them exactly as specified above
3. Refresh the Agra city page to see the new section
4. The section appears above "Why Book Agra Tours with Local Guides"

## 📍 Section Location

The "Things to Do in Agra" section appears:
- ✅ Above "Why Book with Local Guides"
