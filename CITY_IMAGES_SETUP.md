## 📋 **How to Add Images**

1. **Add 1 image per city** to its respective folder
2. **Image format:** JPG, PNG, or AVIF
3. **Recommended size:** 1200x1500px (4:5 aspect ratio)
4. **File size:** Under 500KB (optimized for web)
5. **Naming:** Any name is fine (I'll copy and rename them)

## 🎯 **Image Requirements**

Each city needs **1 hero image** that will be used for:
- Homepage city card
- City page hero section (if needed)

**What makes a good city image:**
- Shows the city's main attraction/character
- High quality and professional
- Represents the city well
- Good composition and lighting

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. ✅ **Folders created** - All 15 folders are ready
2. ⏳ **Add images** - Place 1 image in each folder
3. 🔄 **I'll integrate** - Once images are added, I'll:
   - Copy images to `public/` folder
   - Add cities to `constants.tsx`
   - Update routing in `App.tsx`
   - Cards will appear on homepage automatically

## 💡 **Tips**

- Use high-quality images that represent each city well
- Images should be vertical/portrait orientation (4:5 ratio)
- Make sure images are optimized (under 500KB)
- One image per city is enough for now

Once you add the images, let me know and I'll integrate them all!
