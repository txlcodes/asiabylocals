# 🔐 Instructions for Users Who Already Registered

## For Users Who Registered Before the Fix

If you registered before the login fix was deployed, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (5-10 minutes)
The fix is being deployed automatically. Wait a few minutes for Render to update the site.

### Step 2: Try Logging In
1. Go to: `https://www.asiabylocals.com/supplier`
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Sign In"

### Step 3: If Login Still Fails

#### Option A: Email Not Verified
If you see "Email not verified":
1. Check your inbox for the verification email
2. Click the verification link
3. Then try logging in again

**OR** use "Resend Verification Email":
1. Go to the supplier page
2. Click "Resend Verification Email"
3. Check your inbox
4. Click the new verification link
5. Then log in

#### Option B: Wrong Password
If you see "Email or password is incorrect":
1. Make sure you're using the exact password you set during registration
2. Check for typos (password is case-sensitive)
3. Try copying and pasting the password

#### Option C: Account Not Found
If you see "Email or password is incorrect" and you're sure the password is right:
1. The account might not have been created properly
2. **Solution**: Register again with the same email
   - The system will detect existing email
   - It will resend verification email
   - Then you can verify and log in

### Step 4: Still Having Issues?

**Contact Support:**
- Email: `info@asiabylocals.com`
- Include:
  - Your email address
  - When you registered
  - What error message you see

## What Was Fixed?

The login system was trying to connect to `localhost:3001` instead of the production server. This is now fixed - login will automatically use the correct server URL.
